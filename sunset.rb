closed system? Why blue paper? What did you think of his trousers? How is
it that he lost an ear? Why is this popcorn a bright shade of yellow? If the
writing could change me, could I then change the writing? Are there not
times when you imagine that you were just born horny? How shall we look
at that truck? Don’t you love to go by the used appliances store, past those
old white stoves lined up on the sidewalk? Is this the formal announcement
of spring? How is it we never get to the beach? In what way is this not six
months ago? Did you ever see a yellow helicopter before? Can you feel the
wind in the grass, on your back, on your neck? Can you see those hills
across the water? How does a black dog differ from a white one? What is
the formal process of flying a kite? How do these terms carry intention
beyond the weight of one another? Is this a skill? Is this a man in a hard
hat? Are you asleep? Are you sorry? Are you amusing or amused? Do
sentence types limit what we say? Why does my toe ache, my knee feel stiff?
Is not communication an act of violence? Is not writing an act of privacy?
What is the long grass like to lie down on? Do you notice how sailors
wander about in the lower plazas of the park? Are they a couple? Is that dog
trained to fight? Can you feel how near spring is? Is that scaffolding about
that tower? What is it about looking directly into your eyes at the instant of 
penetration? Can sentences tell us how we change? Are those words not
stored or hidden in the ink? Do you see those two women, sunning
themselves, sharing a joint? How does the day form? Is that her on her way
back? Are those the sounds of seals? What is the smell of summer? Why did
you bring a flag? What is the origin of the emotions? Can I repel you? Can I
reveal you? Can I define you? Can I set you up for a hit? Can I make you
cry? Can I make you choke? Can I name you? Can I fuck you, casually and
without emotion? Can I put my cock in your mouth? Can I push it to the
back of your throat? How hard do you want it? Is this the chronicle of our
turning and our turning away? Is this going to get me somewhere? Will this
make collective life any easier? To what extent is the transcendental simply a
new form of damage? Is it dawn yet? Why are the cats meowing? What fills
the sky with such a dull ochre light? What is it that makes my life seem so
“obvious” and clear to me now? How is it that I should know you? What
are the forms we fill? Am I not simply a balding, bearded, fat, half-toothless,
farting excuse for a poet? Are we not the very garbage of our lives? Is this
the shit we roll about in? Is there some limit to it? Is there some odor to it?
Does it change if I say fragrance for odor? What is the dream that leaves
you screaming? Did you ever want to fuck Daddy/Mommy? Do you know
of those Indians who travel about at night only in two old wired-together
Caddies, sleeping in them by day, eating white bread soaked in bacon
grease? Is that the sun in the east? In the west? Is this how we got together,
only to later change our minds? Is it true you got up to write this,
halfawake? In what way is changing your feelings not changing your mind?
Is it far now? Are those the rudy boys? Is this natural light? Is that
wandering about the rooms of the house an indicator of anxiety, of
resignation to and hatred of the job to which she must soon leave, to sell
panties and bras under the fluorescent glare of Department Store? Do you
hear what it is I’m telling you, really? Why can’t we see the air? Why don’t
we see that the sky is an object, that to be in it is as real as to be in the
forest, the pine wood? Why sell ice cream? Why does he write quietly,
sitting at an old school desk in the high-ceilinged yellow room? Do your 
hands shake? Can you locate the forms? What is the hidden nature of any
late winter? How is it that flowering kills the coleus? Doesn’t the very fact
of a question indicate the distance between the words we use and their
meaning? Why is it that this text surrounds us, envelopes us, forms a circle
but does not solve the problem? Did we think to arrive at an emotion, a
meaning, only to discover the location of its absence? What is it that permits
you to ignore my intentions? Would it be different, reversed, if I could
imagine that you could get me pregnant? Isn’t the problem of the question
that it locates us, places us in a relation, some tangible formulation, to the
text or the act of the text, as if to test meaning, to see if it will exist if we can
thus somehow fix all of the other terms in our equation? How is it this
bridges us? If I come in your mouth now or you come in mine, is it any
different than our knowing the answer to the question? Isn’t it true that
what we know is that we won’t ever be able to pose the question correctly?
Why does the cat sit in front of the air vent? At what point do you give up?
Is surrender a solution? Is not what we have here a superimposition of three
layers? Why is it that I want to look at you at the moment of penetration?
What is that sense of recognition in your eyes which indicates that you sense
my cock rubbing, pushing, against the walls of your cunt? Where else can
you find a poem that tells you what it tells you? Do you think of your brain
as solid or fluid? Why do you deliberately put certain sentences into several
poems? Can you tell that I am writing on Easter? That I have Terry Riley on
the stereo? That I am typing up the letters of Paul Metcalf? That I could
insert anything, say anything, in this space? But that to say it is to exclude
other possibilities? Is it love or fear? How do you tell them apart? How do
you know she comes from New Jersey? Does it surprise you that people are
fragile, that one thing goes wrong and a whole life destructs, that it happens
all the time? Do you know the story of the man who drowned in a vat of
molten chocolate? Do you know the difference between an elephant and a
loaf of bread? Do you recall the day at Disneyland when you heard that Ty
Cobb died? What were you doing when you heard about JFK? So what?
What are the non-cognitive aspects of the city, of the elbow, of the 
question? Why must we be relentless? Should I look for the borders to this
poem on the page or in my life? What is it about that downer, that it should
leave me so hung over? Why do I sweat so, all the time? Is not what we
experience now just one another’s limits? In what way is your selfishness a
shell, an impenetrable thing? Have I not thus left myself open to such
abuse? Why is it that I am unable to separate anger from desire? Do you see
the ladybug wending through the clover? Can you feel the breeze on the
soles of your feet? Did you go back to the park for a reason? Isn’t food,
uncooked, the only real metaphor for the modern condition? Is that a
hammer in the distance? Does this poem not point toward all others? Does
it hone inclusion of the sound of autos, of skateboards, blackbirds, running
water? Have you ever just stopped to watch the way in which guys go
around trying to hustle women? Did you ever meet a man who really
believed he had reached his sexual peak in his teens? Can anybody tell that,
as I wrote this, I grew a beard? Did you see her just get up and walk away?
Did you see it as that? Which is the dog’s bark and which the echo? If I told
you what my flaws were, would either of us believe me? Did you ever hear
the one about the butcher with the wooden leg? Is it so strange that I
should prefer margarine? What do you make of those dudes who stumble
around the city, muttering, still fighting the war? Which are the experiences
you are not open to? Is it slower here, airier? Is it more relaxed? Is caution
not a limit, a thing to be rid of? Would you put anything into your cunt that
you wouldn’t put in your mouth? Are those birds on the water? Where do
those liners go, pulling slowly out of the harbor? Have you ever seen the
stone of the great Lefty O’Doul, big black stone with white marble bat and
ball, lifetime batting average inscribed thereon? What does it mean to have a
house in the hills, an Alfa Romeo, and a wife who runs around? Would
these questions in some other order continue to be these questions? Are
you hungry? Would you like something to drink? Can you hear that cat
meowing to get in? Why does your knee hurt so? Why did you both bend
down and pick up acorns, hurling them as if to see who could throw the
furthest? What are you heating the water for? Why is it that painters now are 
so obsessed with the elimination of space, that composers want to obliterate
time, that writers feel compelled to remove the referential? Are you tired to
the point of being dizzy? Why does the old man trill his R’s? What are you
going to do? How will you get there? How will you handle it? Will it worry
you? Has it changed you? How could it be that our knowledge is limited,
not by the state of the universe (existence, whatever), but by cognitive
capacity, that we should only know what we can know, which is not what
there is, the whole story? Are you certain? Are you sure? What if you
removed the words from your work? How can you say that this poem
would have existed, even had it never been written down, because it would
have been “logical” for it, at a certain point, to exist? What is Bo Diddley’s
hair like underneath that hat? Did you make out the rent check? Do you
know the difference between speech and writing? Would you sincerely like
to be rich? Does each potholder strewn about this honey-caked, crumbridden
table articulate a separate story? Do you use oregano? How many
systems do we involve just to name one thing? If we lie on the mattress in
the closed-off old back porch at 90 degree angles, your legs lifted so that,
lying on my side, I enter from behind, the fingertips of my right hand
stroking your clitoris, and we go about this slowly, almost lazily, does it
make for better understanding? Have you noticed how there are no fathers
in the park playing ball with their daughters? Do the words fold, fold back?
Is it time to think time? Do the words time? How many times? Is it
locatable? Has it a space? Does it have a secret? When will you tell it? Are
you anxious? Are you ready? Is it simply because you do it? Arc we inside it
or is it in front of us? Will the clouds burn off? What is it like to not work?
Have you any further questions? Are my eyes really brown? How will you
feel when we’re in New York? Is this what is called Young and Hungry?
Who are you really and what were you before? What do you like to worry
about most? Does the idea of gay cops bug you? What if each word had a
purpose? What is a construct? Are we on the right bus? Which language is
being spoken here? How do our lives absorb stress? When is an act
complete? Is that apt to be a school? Is it simply enough to lie beside you 
under a tree on a windy day in the park? Can you remember when this was
art? What makes you think it’s a secret? Which one is the mooch? What is it
that you expect to find in India? Did you do your dishes? Is it that you
prefer to be awake when the sun comes up? Are we closer or are we farther
apart? Is poetry simply another channel for one’s careerism? Will a turtle
bite a tomahawk? Is there any poetic writing? What is to be done? What is
literature? How come I woke up with such a swollen lip? Do you see the
hot-walks lounging about the track, trading wagers, tips, waiting for their
horses to get back? What will you do in India? Why call this poem “Things
To Do In Juvenile Hall”? Does this become a record of change? Whoever
heard of giving someone a chicken for their birthday? What in the poem is
not intention? Are you waiting for a ride? Would you like to party? Has your
attitude about sound come around? How long have we worked at this, a
little at a time? Just how hard is it? Is there a bottleneck? Is there much time
left? What am I going to do? What’ll I do when I grow up? Will I at some
point come to a realization? Will I curb my arrogance? Will I be forced to
play my hand? Will it be tipped? Is that an arrowhead or a shark’s tooth?
Was it any different the last time? Why have we had such mediocre
weather? Does anger have a focus? Have we got a fix? Is it all just chatter,
intended to flatter? Would you call this morning yet? Would you call it
anticipation? Why does he always wear neckties loose at the neck? Is it what
you expected? Is it what you had hoped for? What next? Is it relief? Is it
joy? Is this handwriting a sign of a profound disturbance? Where is my ride?
Why do this blue ink on blue paper? Is it the end of the tunnel? Is it just
beginning? Do you see that fog up ahead? Do you see how that works?
How would you explain yourself? How did it happen? Did it happen? How
did it happen? Did it repeat itself? Was it any good? Was it any fun? How
did you come to ride in an old black Mustang with a Chicano watch
repairman and a Japanese dental technician? Can you write in a moving
vehicle? Will you support the idea? Have they fixed it? Have they taken it
in? Is it painted red? How is it if I ask about it some other way? Are these
sentences embedded here? Do you understand subjacency? Do you see how 
the hills are browning now? Are those cardboard cows? Is it just one thing
after another? What did Bernstein say to make you ask so many questions?
What is memory but the inverse of expectation? Does it pay to live in the
world? Who else would do a thing like this? Do you see how it ties down
the vocabulary? Do you see how it posits you the reader? Who else would
speak to you, for you? Is it a song of innocence? Can you count on it? Did it
just come? Did it just flow? Why do they call it Tamal? Do you see how he
tailgates? Does it matter if one of us is half-crazy? What does it mean to be
inside you, with you? Is this what the writing was? Can you feel it, pushing
in, pulling out? Is it more than friction? Is it fiction? Does the deal go
down? Who is that on the phone? Can you fathom it? Did the mail come?
Did he come? Did you ever, as he came, just hold it, not swallow it, then
lean forward to kiss him, letting his own come spill into his mouth, from
one tongue onto another? Are we getting close? Can you feel the hum, the
vibration? Are these kites large enough for us to ride them, to sail out over
the water? Do you see how that haze obliterates the horizon, sea become
sky become sea? What did Wordsworth see, looking down into that valley?
What is behind your language? Are you your vocabulary or are you your
syntax? If we push you, shove you, what will we find? Can you hear what
you are thinking under what you are reading? Does it at times drown the
reading out? Would you just go out to the ocean one day and begin to swim,
outward without limit toward a vague conclusion? What of a poem that
stretched from summer to summer? Does the sky in your mind have a limit?
Did you go into that phase and go through it? What kept you here? Where
do the words come from? What if we drained them of their meaning just to
see what remained? What if we said that we had done this thing? Can you
give a yes or no answer? Can you say it in a few short words? How is it with
all this language there is still this thing so vast that we have no name for it,
even if we sense it as a thing we have seen? Were the words trapped in the
pen, just waiting? Did they burst, sperm-like, into meaning in our mouths?
Can you taste it? Can you feel it? What about it?"
