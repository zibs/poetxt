                    <p>Revolving door. Ron Silliman’s <a href="http://www.ucpress.edu/content/pages/10742/10742.ch01.pdf"><em><u>Ketjak</u></em></a>, the first poem from <a href="http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520250161"><b>The Age of Huts (compleat)</b></a> (University of California Press, 2007) is fungal. Is fun: “Gross national poet”, “Your syntax is a life sentence”, “I don’t make the language, I enforce it (24, 47, 50). Is fungal: “A writing that grows out of itself, a poetry of mould” (16). Such antecedent fungal poetics could be found in John Cage’s poetry, particularly in “Writing through the Cantos” (and “Writing for the Fourth Time through Finnegans Wake”)  in which predetermined phrases grow out of the text - “and thEn with bronZe lance heads beaRing yet Arms / sheeP slain Of plUto stoNg praiseD  -  in this case the name Ezra Pound (<a href="http://books.wwnorton.com/books/978-0-393-34186-7/"><b>Postmodern American Poetry ed. Paul Hoover 2nd ed.</b>, 22</a>). </p> <br><br>
                    <p>In Ketjak, however, the fungal poetic operates on the level of the sentence. As spores which both accumulate or repeat variously, appearing and reappearing throughout the poem, such sentences posit a poem of “[i]nfinite expansion”: for example, a recurring phrase, often marking the end of a “section” at first reads: “A sequence of objects which to him appears to be a caravan of fellaheen, a circus, begins a slow migration to the right vanishing point on the horizon line”, 90 pages later - after other minor appearances and mutations -  becomes “A sequence of objects, silhouettes, which to him appears to be a caravan of fellaheen, a circus, dromedaries pulling wagons bearing tiger cages, fringed surreys, tamed ostriches in toy hats, begins a slow migration to the right vanishing point, signified by a palm tree on the horizon” (1, 95). Such an example reinforces another recurring dictum: “One could propose, for example, the inclusion of anything” (12&<em>passim</em>). The poem expanding as it proceeds.</p>

                   <p> Revolving door. The point of invoking Cage is that Silliman’s poetic here, like Cage’s work, is highly attuned to the specificity of each perception, of time’s continual impression upon impressions. Cage says “If you listen to Beethoven, it’s always the same, but if you listen to traffic, it’s always different": <br>
                    <iframe class ="center-block" width="800" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pcHnL7aS64Y" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>  <br>
                    And such is the conceit of Cage's 4’33”. Each moment of perception is freshness; “Old sentences heard new carry a different purpose”, writes Silliman numerous times throughout, pointing to the effect of context, the way words weigh differently upon their repetition (12&<em>passim</em>).  The lucidity of this is made most overt when Silliman writes: “Each event will be its own name. A clear thing. This is the fable of objects. Infinite expansion” (37).  Just as that “sequence of objects” phrase recurs, although grammatically identical at times, it always indicates a new moment in the poem. But it is never “the same”, but like a spore, always relational to its likeness. The “fable of objects” is the promulgation that they are static, or fixed, as if language itself were also immutable, rock solid (“Earth science”) (1&<em>passim</em>)). Neither are. Instead at such moments of “repetition” we actually see the differences between “identical” phrases. Like traffic.  </p>

                    <p>Revolving door. Is this the form of a poem? A revolving door of perceptions appearing in a sequence -  “words in a line pass time” - horizontally and vertically (20).  These two words - “revolving door” - form the first and only sentence of the initial paragraph, as well as all subsequent paragraphs, one of which eventually accumulates and “repeats” phrases in an “infinite expansion”, fermenting into a paragraph over fifty pages long. Still, these two words form the beginning of each section. The key word in that last sentence, “form”, these words are one of the few identifiable elements of repetition acting as a structural anchor to the otherwise extensively paratactic paragraphs. </p>

                    <p>Concerning form, two separate passages state: “I want a form to cancel form” and “A series having no beginning and no end as its condition of form” (63, 89). And one can follow this logic wherein after 63 pages of reading and “re”-reading similar sentences in different positions, Silliman writes: “Now I will ask the reverse questions” (63). Except there have been no questions yet. Yet pages later the form of the poem dramatically deviates - reverses -  from expectations. If there was a form to the poem in the first place, which is an assumption (“Identify the assumptions, define them” (47)). Nevertheless, in this shift, those words, previously so charged with significance - “revolving door” - now appear in the middle of the paragraph, unremarkable. It is a marvelous unraveling. Here the form cancels itself out, and what was ostensibly a series of phrases, loses its beginning, its form.  But again, some twenty pages later we get the statement: “Flaw permitted to remain for specific aesthetic reasons, or perhaps intentionally inserted” (89). Of course, how to know if this “flaw” is the one I’m thinking it is? Why would this be a flaw anyways? </p>

                    <p>Nonetheless, the most explicit definition of form we get is: “Form is to seize time” (38). And this poem is explicitly postdated as being temporally bounded, being composed between “2 June-17 November 1974” (101). Such statements are congruent with Charles Bernstein’s ludic performance “What Makes a Poem a Poem”: 
                        <br>

                    Bernstein’s focus on “timing” is like Cage’s and Silliman’s in that time provides a form to a poem, be it time to have read or written in. For example, one could propose the inclusion of anything. For example, I read this poem in one sitting over 4 hours last night July 14th 2015.

                    <p>Revolving door. Consider the ideation: “If words were bells” (16). Or, if we take the dictum from another poem in this collection, <a href="http://www.ubu.com/ubu/pdf/silliman_chinese.pdf"><b>The Chinese Notebook</b></a>: “220. When I return here to ideas previously stated, that’s rhyme” (176). What does this mean for a poem consisting of variously repeating words and reforming phrases. What are the resonances, the harmonies, the dissonances, the interference patterns, of such a reading? For example, the phrase, “[h]ow will I know when I make a mistake” repeats a number of times before mutating into “[h]ow will i know when I make a mistake, that, says, your hand as I shake it, fleshy palm, pudgy fingers, is not my imagination” - what would be this chiming errory of solipsism (53). Or that “Liner notes to a Dylan album” is writ thirty pages before the lines “Crying like a fire in the sun”, lyrics from “It’s All Over Now Baby Blue” from the album Bringing It All Back Home (94):  <br><iframe class= "center-block" width="800" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ntveBZsYtlM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    <br> Similarly, “[e]ach sentence is a solution” appears four pages after “[a]rt as habit merges with the renewal of solutions that constitute it”(33, 29). Or how about that “[i]t is not as though our lives bear intended meaning, but that it gathers about us like fallen leaves which someone has failed to sweep away” is preceded by “Brushing dry leaves off dead poets” eight pages earlier (28, 36). So what. “Endless intimate detail ultimately bores” first appears halfway through the poem, ringing out crystal (51).

                    <p>Or what about that. Or what about this. Deictics are exhausted by the poem: "[t]his this this this" (23, 46, 89). Or what about that we get “[r]efuse connectedness” on the very same page as the final (re)appearance of  “[a] sequence of objects, silhouettes, which to him appears to be a caravan of fellaheen, a circus, dromedaries pulling wagons bearing tiger cages, fringed surreys, tamed ostriches in toy hats, begins a slow migration to the right vanishing point, signified by a palm tree on the horizon” (95). A phrase that recurs from the "beginning" of the poem all the way to the "end". Or what about the diametrically opposing, “[w]e want coherence”, with “[t]hought is a labyrinth” (11, 10). Finally, fungally, rethink your perceptions. Leave room, for example, for the inclusion of anything. Imagine this as rhyming, especially when the ideas returned to are contradictory. What does that sound like.Or what about this. Try to hear all of this as music, as bells ringing, as traffic also seen through a revolving door.
