        		<p>When starting. And where. What. When and where to start with Raworth’s newest collection <a href="http://www.carcanet.co.uk/cgi-bin/indexer?product=9781784100339"><b>As When</b></a>? Temporality since the question begs it. The "when-ness" in Raworth exposes time's riddled materiality - bear with me - through its frequency of inquiry, and through its frequencies, as when tuning into a radio station, tuning into an awareness of temporality is a leitmotif of his oeuvre. Raworth's poetry makes time feel textured. One example of this is a poem sequence dedicated to Ed Dorn entitled “Stag Skull Mounted on Wall” in which each poem is titled by a timestamp.  The end of the poem  “9.30 pm. May 13th. 1970” reads: “to fashion  / this from the jerks of thought and vision” (30). "This" being  the poem itself, which is composed from "jerks of thought and vision". Coupling this method of composition with the poem's title as a specific time results in a temporality of jerkiness. The poem is a time composed of yanking moments. Often this type of jerkiness in Raworth’s poetry is expressed through a jarring of syntactical arrangements, shifting tenses, missing conjunctions, and clashing semantics that are continously distracted.  "So we drive off in any distraction" writes Raworth in the long poem "<a href="https://media.sas.upenn.edu/pennsound/authors/Raworth/Rockdrill-5/Raworth-Tom_01_Writing_Writing_Rockdrill-5_2004.mp3">Writing</a>" (not included in this collection). This type of jolting reading experience is one which tunes one into time through language. Raworth's language wrangles time to present it motly, the page and poem being where "everything stops there at strange angles" maybe only for a minute(1). This poetic reveals that time is ridged, angular, spasmodic, that each moment is palpably unique - is anything but the empty homogenous time (in Walter Benjamin's terms) of ceaseless flowing moments we so often conceptualize it as. </p><br><br>
        		<pre class="col-md-12 pull-right foundlangra"><em>     i        a rag          of language             <br>              a wor d                              l   ou d <br>b eat ing       air </em> <br><br><br></pre>

        		<p>As the title designates, “9.30 pm. May 13th. 1970”  links Raworth’s writings to a specific moment. Such a moment is then translated  textually, and can be reread or recreated sonically in some future. Another poem, “10.26 pm. June 5th 1970” is only the word “word”, and “10.59 pm. June 5th. 1970” contains no words: it consists only of blank spaces.  It does actually contain spaces/linebreaks however: visually, its vertical length is greater than the preceding or following poems. But these two poems continue the idea of different, multiple jerks of thoughts and visions occurring within time through the interruption of presence, a "word", or absence: " " (30). Later (a temporal adverb), Raworth writes: “(hints for poets) // :speed it up till it’s faster than you / or be the other” (56). The speed, the poetic velocity - movement, jerks and sashays measured and transcribed within time - of Raworth’s poetics must be heard to be fully appreciated ( i suggest listening to "<a href="https://media.sas.upenn.edu/pennsound/authors/Raworth/Rockdrill-4/Raworth-Tom_44_Rockdrill-4_Ace_Ace_2004.mp3">Ace</a>" a key long poem of his, not included in this selection). The unceasing celerity with which Raworth reads reinforces this relationship to time so prevalent in his poetics.  In “Mirror Mirror on the Wheel”, addressing his son and time, he writes: “time, i love you / you are the way / i see the same anew” (84). Through defamiliarization, or distracting tuggings and pluckings, time tunes the poet into the ever present newness that washes over us.</p>

        			<pre class="col-md-12 pull-right foundlangra"><em>     i                 m                       a  ge           <br>             s        ound <br> breath               </em><br></pre>

        		<p>When to being and when to begin. Having begun, Raworth’s poetic is also one of the soundbite. Fragments of the overheard and said-under sprinkle his poems. I was taught to think of it as analogous to listening to the radio - rapidly and continuously tuning into different stations, transcribing the partial. Flicking through TV channels and parsing midbreath expressions. Wade through a crowd copying down every fifth word heard. Such fragments of language are a part of the common argot of their historical/temporal contexts. It is these fragments of the overheard, translated into new contexts, carrying with them traces of their previous history/temporality which creates the kind of temporality in Raworth I’ve suggested: time that is ridged, angular, vectored, “not consistently round” (207). With no consistent sound - no placid predictability of line, phrase, or prosody - these soundbites possess the power to reflect this nuanced temporality. As fragments they have continuous beginnings, and are charged with the irruptive force of the past. As they enter into new contexts, their interruption into the present  “illuminates a world...breathing its air” (220). A random selection from the long poem “West Wind” goes:
        		</p>

        		<p class="centerquote col-md-offset-4">
				set yellow <br>
				what distance <br>
				between the double orange lines <br>
				in a roman wall? <br>
				ground ivy <br>
				smothers bluebells <br>
				a trace horse <br>

				golden moon <br>
				pain that hides <br>

				triumphing over water (164)</p>
				<p>Here notions of the quotidian, of fluidity, of form, of the celestial, of textuality, of authority, of the pastoral or bucolic, of the geometrical, and of the geographical (amongst others) are collaged through extensive enjambment, elision, indeterminacy, and yet the passage remains evocative and lyrical in this selected soundbite of a soundbite, a meta-soundbite if you will. Its not nonsense: “to understand thought / be no explicable reason” but more like n<em>an</em>sense - sense that is surpising - there is no explicable reason to understand thought, and to understand thought be no explicable reason (for, to)... (220). Sense is multidirectional, shifting, aurally, visually, temporally. This indeterminacy, these elisions, these shards of sense and sentences, pulse and push the poem forward, dragging, yanking, jerking the reader along, tuning them in to the daily happening plexus of events, invitingly. </p>
