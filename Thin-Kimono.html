                <p>For Michael Earl Craig's newest collection <a href="http://www.wavepoetry.com/products/thin-kimono"><b><u>Thin Kimono</u></b></a>, <a href="http://www.wavepoetry.com/"><b><u>Wave Books</u></b></a> had <a href="http://www.quemadura.net/"><u>Quemadura</u></a> (aka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Clark_%28designer%29"><u></u>Jeff Clark</a>) design a cover that is visually stripped with sparse scatterings of muted colors randomly dashed and streaking across it. These minimal markings are countered and anchored by a thin, majuscule, serif typeface, that is at once quite thin in its crossbars, and quite thick in the stem. The aleatoric background contrasts with the deliberate, marked font, and may be a useful way to consider this collection of poetry. For there is here, at least in terms of semantics and content, a concern with the aleatory: many poems deal with the quotidian, thinking into the dailinesses of life; random objects and random events and their relations. But amidst these random occurrences, the dashes and streaks of being, there is, like the typeface, a definitive and palpable observer: a solid, reoccurring voice and identifiable "I". The book works through a number of different forms, primarily an O'Hara-ian-esque <em>I did this and then I did that</em> poetic of the quotidian through a combination of dramatic monologues and lyrical investigations. </p>
                <p>There are of course, exceptions: one is the poem "Diana" which we learn later in <em>Notes & Acknowledgements</em> is built from a collage of quotations from "Vida Hursts's  1927 novel <em>Diana</em> (Grosset & Dunlap, New York), with the exception of [the line] 'Stanton took his chocolates and left', which was added by the author" (107). This post-conceptual poem - think a conceptual poem, but with a markedly authorial intervention - with its ?in?significant? intervention could act as a sort of refusal on Craig's part to engage in these different contemporary poetics, opting instead to work more in "traditional" forms. This is not a criticism. But rather I notice in the opening poem, "Do Not Disturb", not quite an aversion to the "avant-garde" or other contemporary formalist experimentation, but rather a disinterest. This poem is entirely italicized and resembles (if anyone else has read it) the prelude of Cormac McCarthy's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suttree"><b><u>Suttree</u></b></a> in typography, register (an authorial, almost highfalutin narrator), and grammatical mood: both function as an address and readerly invitation.  It also reminds me of Seamus Heaney's "The Forge":</p>
                <img class = "center-block img-responsive" src="img/theforge.png" alt="Seamus Heaney's The Forge">
                <p>in its elevation of the value of discipline, and a preference for a mythopoeic or time-honoured praxis (biographically as well, Craig is a farrier and has probably spent some time beating "real iron out"), as opposed to experimentation of form or self-reflexive linguistic investigation. Craig's opening poem is explicit - "I assure you" - that there is some form of contemporary contribution that would be "wholly unnecessary" (9). This is similar to Heaney's "leans out on the jamb...then grunts and goes in", the whole, yeah there are different ways of doing things, but I'm going to do what I know how, type of mentality. The tone is not so much pretentious as it happily contemptuous. Like both Heaney and McCarthy, although the comparisons are a bit haphazard I admit, not that Craig is very similar or totally unlike either of these writers necessarily, but there is I think, in all three of them, a type of disinterest, or aversion, to perhaps what could only be called the "fashion of the age", the zeitgeist, at least as far as experimentation in form is concerned, subject matter is a totally different concern. Geez it feels hard to make my point here: I'm just trying to say that Craig's formal tendencies are grounded, thorough, and solid, even as it may eschew (slightly) other experimental ones.</p>
                <p>Oh yeah, the <em>totally</em> Nietzschean anti-academy poem also has me thinking about this. "Today For Example", is an <em>exemplum</em> poem that is didactic, revealing, and almost allegorical. The poet ponders: "every now and then I wonder if I fucked up with this horseshoeing thing, but then I talk with my friends in academia and, well, I'm okay with my choices" (15). The poem then catalogues mundane occurrences of the day "It was raining the mountains", alongside the work performed with the ostensibly personified horses that are metonymic (perhaps) of the poet's "friends": for example, "Jimmy (unsure about the world, collapses violently when he hears loud noises, likes to cut himself)" (15). Funny, and I haven't touched on Craig's integration of comedy into his poetics yet, but beyond funny, what is the critique or comment about academia or "intellectualism" here? I think there is a line that follows from the same "wholly uneccessary" comment made earlier in that the poet here prefers their alternative in the end to occupy a position of decisive difference, even if they relegate it as perhaps being more "simplistic" or "rural", as the straightforward syntax of the final sentences suggests. </p>

            <article class="col-md-10">
                <p>This is also touched upon in what is perhaps the most self-reflexive poem of the collection "The Neighbour". The poem involves a neighbour asking the poet, "But seriously, who is it you're writing these for? / Surely you have an audience in mind" (96). The answer from the poet is: "the poems were written for me, or for / readers who were exactly the same person I was" (96). The poet goes on to consider how this may seem a bit "solipsistic" and the poem ends with a dinner roll rolling into another room with a door closing behind it. Heh. </p>
                <p>What I'm interested in here - and maybe throughout all of Craig's work - is the relation of poetry to a cinematic medium, be it television or film. The movement or logic of many of the poems here seem based off of motifs from television or movies. The trope of a door closing behind one as they enter it feels televisual, like something I've seen happen on TV in multiple contexts. There are also a number of sitcom-like twenty-second narrative poems that end with a bang-like punchline. There is definitely a sense of closure, even dopamine, reading these. The form works to be sure, but I'm still struck with how cinematic, but not just cinematic, but particularly television-like, particularly sitcom-like perhaps, they feel. How almost oneiric, as if I've come across scenes like these in other times and places before reading the poem. This is not to say they are unoriginal, (as in banal, not the Perloffian kind), but they are uncanny. And I'm not quite sure to what end they are working, especially when coupled with the <em>ars poetica</em> I quoted earlier: if the audience is meant to be the poet himself - who is the poet - especially if the poems often feel like TV scenes. Another TV poet I think of is John Ashbery, but that is more cartoon poetry, I think. I'm not going to back up any of these claims by the way, just feel it out here. Maybe two poems in this collection, and they're near the beginning, feel sort of like Ashbery, but Craig's formalism is far too taut to be Ashberian, too calculated, too scripted (like TV). </p>
                <p>The other thing about this TV poetry that interests me - and this should tie in to what I was talking about earlier, what with the poetry seeming to be averse to certain forms, preferring a type of "rural" or traditional formalism to work in - is that Michael Earl Craig was just appointed as the Poet Laureate of Montana. The statement offered by the Montana Arts Council runs: </p>
                  <pre class = "text-center">"He personifies rural values in that he makes his living from working with horses, but oddly - and fortunately for us - he is also one of the preeminent poets of our day." </pre>
                <p>The word "rural" here intrigues me. And again, the signaling that he doesn't <em>work</em> as a poet, like on the back of the book, but rather that he just <em>writes</em> it, and writes it well, <em>"oddly"</em> enough. </p>

          <article class="col-md-10">
            <p>I'm interested in what Craig is doing with all of this. I'm interested in the relationship between TV, poetics, and the rural lifestyle. How do these mediums filter and reflect each other? Both poetry and television work a certain magic, and I think Craig integrates both these mediums with a flourish. Like how Benjamin compares the surgeon-as-camerman with magician-as-painter, Craig works through all of these. The poetics are acupuncturist in this sense. The acupuncture trope is significant as poems with the poet going in for acupuncture structure the work, occurring in the beginning, middle, and end of the collection. I think the title "Thin Kimono" can also be a read (weakly) as reference to Asia and the origins of acupuncture. The poems act as jabs, as interruptions, and redirections of flows of images, of pre-existing <em>motifs</em> and language. They pierce and poke at everyday life, which must also have TV in it.</p>

            <p>For what it's worth, the poem I thought most effective was "Windsor". For me, it is a poem that reveals the farrier lifestyle, if only briefly, and is a poem that actually feels situated in a "rural" landscape that isn't drenched in television. There is one part of this poem that lists the "parts of the horse" (76). It is extensive and continues for about a third of the page. The words here are of equestrian specialization: "fetlocks; hooves; coronets; / pasterns; cannons; hock;" - all parts of a horse I've never heard of. It feels like the language of the lifestyle, of the landscape. The words themselves are enough, no flourishes necessary.</p>
