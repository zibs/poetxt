                <p><a href="http://www.wavepoetry.com/"><b><u>Wave Books</u></b></a> had <a href="http://www.quemadura.net/"><u>Quemadura</u></a> (aka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Clark_%28designer%29"><u></u>Jeff Clark</a>) design a visually stripped cover with sparse scatterings of muted colors randomly dashed and streaking across it countered and anchored by a thin, majuscule, serif, typeface, that is at once, quite thin in its crossbars, and quite thick in the stem. The aleatoric background contrasts with the deliberate, marked font, and may be a useful way to consider this collection of poetry: this well-crafted haptic object that is Michael Earl Craig's newest collection <a href="http://www.wavepoetry.com/products/thin-kimono"><b><u>Thin Kimono</u></b></a>. For there is here, at least in terms of semantics and content, a concern with the aleatory: many poems deal with the quotidian, thinking into the dailinesses of life, objects and events and their relations. But admist these random occurences, the dashes and streaks of being, like the typeface, there is a definitive and palpable observer, a solid, reoccuring voice and identifiable "I". The book works through a number of different forms, primarily an O'Hara-ian-esque <em>I did this and then I did that</em> poetic of the quotidian through a combination of dramatic monologues and lyrical investigations. </p>

                <p>There are of course, exceptions: one is the poem "Diana" which we learn later in <em>Notes & Acknowledgements</em> is built from a collage of quotations from "Vida Hursts's  1927 novel <em>Diana</em> (Grosset & Dunlap, New York), with the exception of [the line] 'Stanton took his chocolates and left', which was added by the author. This post-conceptual poem - think a conceptual poem, but with a markedly authorial intervention - with its ?in?significant? intervention could act as a sort of refusal on Craig's part to engage in these different contemporary poetics, opting instead to work more in "traditional" forms. This is not a criticism. But rather I notice in the opening poem, "Do Not Disturb", not quite an aversion to the "avant-garde" or  other contemporary experimental formalism, but rather a disinterest. This poem is entirely italicized and resembles both (if anyone else has read it) the prelude of Cormac McCarthy's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suttree"><b><u>Suttree</u></b></a> on a typographical level, the register (an authorial, almost highfalutin narrator) and grammatical mood, the form is of an address and readerly invitation, as well as Seamus Heaney's "The Forge":</p>
                <img class = "center-block img-responsive" src="img/theforge.png" alt="Seamus Heaney's The Forge">
                <p>in its elevation of the value of discipline and a preference for a mythopoetic or time-honoured praxis (biographically as well, Craig is a farrier and has probably spent some time beating "real iron out"), again, as opposed to experimentation of form or self-reflexive linguistic investigation. This opening poem is explicit - "I assure you" - that there is some form of contemporary contribution that would be "wholly unnecessary". This is similar to Heaney's "leans out on the jamb...then grunts and goes in", the yeah there it is, but I'm going to do what I know how. The tone is not so much pretentious as it is impatient, maybe even contemptuous. Like both Heaney and McCarthy, although the comparisons are a bit haphazard, not that Craig is very similar or totally unlike either of these writers necessarily, but there is I think, in all three of them, a type of disinterest, or aversion, to perhaps what could only be called the "fashion of the age", the zeitgeist, at least as far - and seriously, these sentences spiral out of control quickly - as experimentation in form is concerned, subject matter is a totally different concern...</p>
                <p>Oh yeah, the <em>totally</em> Nietzschean anti-academy poem also has me thinking about this. "Today For Example", an <em>exemplum</em> poem, didactic and revealing, almost allegorical one could suggest, is a poem wherein the poet ponders: "every now and then I wonder if I fucked up with this horseshoeing thing, but then I talk with my friends in academia and, well, I'm okay with my choices" (15). The poem then catalogues mundane occurences of the day "It was raining the mountains", alongside the work performed with the ostensibly personified horses that are metonymic (perhaps) of the poet's "friends": for example, "Jimmy (unsure about the world, collapses violently when he hears loud noises, likes to cut himself)" (15). Funny, and I haven't touched on Craig's integration of comedy into their poetics yet, but beyond funny, what.</p>
