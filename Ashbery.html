            <p>Something different for this week methinks. But this is a great book and I love it. I haven't read all of it yet, but I will eventually. And who shouldn't? - it seems like <em>everyone</em> loves John Ashbery. Indeed, there's a conceptual poem waiting to be writ that collates each Ashbery rhapsody professed from these past centuries. "He has won nearly every major American award for poetry"; "Ashbery's phenomenological eye fixes itself not so much on ordinary living and doing as on the specific act of composing a poem"; "verbal canvas"; "But it is popularly believed, with some reason, that the style itself is impenetrable"; "Besides, the essential subjects of Ashbery's poetry—subjectivity and time . . .—are themselves general and elusive" etc. etc. etc. All these even just come from the introduction on <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/john-ashbery"><u>The Poetry Foundation</u></a> anyways. </p>

            <p>
                So instead of trying to decode, decipher, didact, elaborate, interrogate, explore, investigate, understand, subvert, expose any misunderstood, unmistakably inappropriate readings of Ashbery, contextualize, or supplement, not that these aren't important, or interesting, or valueable to read at times, I am, instead, just going to throw his most canonized poem, the <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse/124/5#!/20596528"><b><u>Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror</u></b></a> into a computer program that will rewrite it, one which iterates through the poem, replacing each word with its antonym. I call it Self-Portrait in a Concave Mirror.

            <p>For anyone who is curious - the code is really simple, and just runs on top of <a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/"><u>Stanford's Natural Language Processing (NLP) software</u></a>. The code I'm using is written in <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/"><u>Ruby</u></a> and uses the <a href="https://github.com/louismullie/treat"><u>Treat gem</u></a> which just packages up the Stanford NLP for me to use!</p>

            <p>The program basically runs like this: </p>
            <img src="img/rubyash.png" alt="Ashbery code" class = "center-block img-responsive" style = "max-height:600px;">
            <p>I pass in whatever document I want - in this case its an Ashbery poem, but it could be the entire text if I had a pdf, or found a torrent... - whatever, the resulting poem initially looks like this: </p>
            <img src="img/rubyash2.png" alt="Concave Mirror" class = "center-block img-responsive" style = "max-height: 500px;">

        </section>

        <section class="row">
            <p>
                 For comparison, take a look at Ashbery's first few lines:
            </p>

    <section class="row">
            <pre class ="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
                    As Parmigianino did it, the right hand
                    Bigger than the head, thrust at the viewer
                    And swerving easily away, as though to protect 
                    What it advertises
                </pre> 
        </section>
        <section class="row">
            <p>Of course, not every word has an antonym - like what is the antonym of "Parmigianino"? or "[a]s" for that matter? - those two first words of <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse/124/5#!/20596528"><b><u>Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror</u></b></a>...But what you can see there is that the first word the program picks up on is the word "right", as in "the right hand". The result is the word "wrongfulness". Nice. I think the next word it picks up must be "head" since the program outputs "tail". Lol. Definitely not perfect, since I'd expect it to pick up on "[b]igger" and make it into "smaller". Alas. </p>
