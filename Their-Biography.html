            <h4>chapter two</h5>
            <p>Composed of composites <a href="http://bookthug.ca/shop/books/their-biography-an-organism-of-relationships-by-kevin-mcpherson-eckhoff/"><b>Their Biography</b></a> is an agglomerate of poems that are said to be from “friends, family, co-workers, strangers, robots, and even adversaries”. An early poem mimics this process of formation through accumulation through a mineralogical conceit beginning</p>
                <pre>
                KME can only be defined as: 
                65% Oxygen
                18% Carbon
                10% Hydrogen
                3% Nitrogen
                1.5% Calcium
                1.0% Phosphorus

                … (12) </pre>

            <p>and going on to admit “KME also contains trace amounts” of “Lithium...Vanadium, Bromine and Arsenic” (13). Such an interest with traces - and tracing boundaries - becomes a prominent thread of the book; tracing relationships and playing with the boundaries of these relationships suffuses Eckhoff’s ludic engagement with authorial presence and autobiography.</p>

            <h4>chapter six</h4>
            <p>
                While the book is attributed as authored by kevin mcpherson eckhoff, he did not write a word in this collection - aside from the dedication (<em>to a parents</em>) presumably and the concluding “provision”. We know from Jeremy Stewart's Christmas present contribution poem of Eckhoff’s interest (at some point) in Kenneth Goldsmith’s “uncreative” approach to writing. We see this here most simply through the selection and reorganization of texts with a governing conceptual framework: publish a “biographical” work composed from myriad sources. Although this is more complex since instead of merely culling preexisting texts, Eckhoff is the progenitor of these texts, his requests for poems being the actual source text, his preexisting relationships, however fleet, forming an ur-text.

            <h4>chapter nine</h4>
            <p>
                As a text chock-full of missing chapters, an author who does not appear, and its garrulous full title being “their biography: an organism of relationships amassed by & about the object most often identified as one kevin mcpherson eckhoff”, which is, at least syntactically similar to Laurence Sterne’s “The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman”, the intertext of Sterne fits into auto/biographical genre of the digressive, partial, unfinished, ineffable memoire.

                        <p>At least two poems - chapters seventeen chapter forty-one - reference the website: <a href="loveafteradversity.com" target="_blank" id="loveafter">loveafteradiversity.com</a>. The latter chapter invites us to check if Laurel (kevin's partner) is "performing at loveafteradversitydotcom" - the notion of performativity also being a major trope. If you follow the link, wall albescence awaits - Figure 3.6a. Nonetheless, some digging shows that the site is at least owned by kevin: <br>

            <h4 class>chapter fifteen:</h4>
                <p>This mode of writing relates to Eckhoff’s interest in traces/tracings proposed earlier. Alongside the brevity of the poems, their digressive, insular, aleatoric or flarfed language, and the glancing illustrations, the book ends inviting the reader to “consider your finger around these very pages”, to trace your way through the work, what marks do your fingerprints have to do with KME? How now do you relate to kevin?</p>

                    <section class="chapter col-md-12">
                        <h4 class ="text-right">chapter fifty-two</h4>
                        <p>As if to trace an arc, the book also begins with an epigraph (one of three) from bpnichol’s “statement” of seeking one’s self and “the other thru the poem by as many exits and entrances as possible”. In the original text of this epigraph, the “other” bpnichol writes in a preceding paragraph is “the loved one, and the other is the key, often the reason for the need/desire to communicate” (<a href="http://catalogue.pearsoned.ca/educator/product/Canadian-Literature-in-English-Texts-and-Contexts-Vol-2/0321494008.page">Canadian Literature in English Vol II, 513</a>). Here we are given 64 different poems, 64 different entrances and exits to “kevin” in this collection, to think about how each of them interact, relate, and build off each other: in this “organism of relationships”, what recurs? That he lives in rural bc (Salmon Arm) arises numerous times, that he’s “goofy” or “so funny”, as well as “onanistic”, that his email address is metrophobic@gmail.com, and that his “bff” jake kennedy’s email is jakedavidkennedy@gmail.com. Some streak of intimacy effortlessly imprints itself on me.</p>

                        <h4>chapter thirty-nine</h4>
                        <p>Coupled with the array of texts chosen and their modes of composition, there are also traces of Deleuze and Guattari's ideation in <a href="http://projectlamar.com/media/A-Thousand-Plateaus.pdf" target="_blank">A Thousand Plateaus</a> of the  assemblage: they state “[a] book has neither object nor subject; it is made of variously formed matters, and very different dates and speeds”. Such a composite is deemed an “assemblage”, a “multiplicity”, composed by many, and yet by (n)one (4). They propose to “never ask what a book means”, but rather “ask what it functions with in connection with what other things it does or does not transmit intensities, in which other multiplicities its own are inserted and metamorphosed” (4). To wit, trace whits. Trace the boundaries of relationships through the many exits and entrances between one’s self/ves and others. Trace amounts amount; we get a glimpse of kevin, “kevining” around, and glimpses of those circumambient. Their biography leaks into our own simply by reading it - and contingently, you reading this.   </p>

                        <p>We open up the source code of the site - figure 9.v.0 - pushing toward the kevinsource, to see if there are any traces of kevin's writings, even if only in html.</p> 
                        <p>Instead we see the site contains, technically, two sites. That purple &ltiframe&gt tag indicates another browser window is displayed within the current browser; a website performing as another. Following the link there links us back to another whitesite, only this time, its source code sends us to a different place: <p>
