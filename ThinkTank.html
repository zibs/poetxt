                     The dominant typographical element in Julie Carr’s <a href="http://solidobjects.myshopify.com/products/julie-carr-think-tank"><b>Think Tank</b></a> (Solid Objects 2015) is an asterisk. Structurally, the book is divided into four sections - plus a fifth section for “Notes” which contains a list of works cited throughout. Each of these four sections (excluding the first) are denoted as beginning with an enlarged asterisk. It is important  and should be noted that the etymology of asterisk is literally, little star. And while on this formal, macropoetic level these asterisks separate the poems, micropoetically they also separate each strophe; that is to say, each poem consists of poem-fragments strung together by these starmarks which begin each poem-fragment.

            </section>
            <section class="row">
                <p>The result of this lends itself easily to astronomical analogy. That is to say, these asterisk or starmarked strophes and sections form a constellatory poetic. That is to say, it is a poetic marked by various moments of alignment, be it in constellations of content or in form. There are for example, various linguistic reflections throughout, and one section concludes: </p>
                    <pre class = "text-center">[t]he sentences are grammatical and taut. This annun-
                        ciation
                        flowers by rhetoric: vegetal verbs. (18)</pre>

                <p>I've tried to imitate the linebreaks as much as possible, so note the enjambed "annunciation" that is split into its morpheme, which sonically emphasizes its near-homophone <em>enunciation</em> as well. A sentence like this which is loaded with language about language raises the question of how we sound ourselves (enunciate), but as well as how other things may sound themselves (announce). What are, exactly, vegetal verbs, beyond an alliterative declaration - is their grammar also "taut"? - and, what are the flowers of rhetoric, does it reference how speechblooms or is it just floweryspeech? Later in the collection we hear, "The wind is all one pretty word" (63), and later, "I heard a woman speaking through the mouth of a dog" (70). Speech, sound, and voicing are all constellating <em>motifs</em> of the work. This notion also infuses the textual layout of the poems wherein they resemble what Charles Olson refers to as the "scoring" of sound on a page (<a href="http://writing.upenn.edu/~taransky/Projective_Verse.pdf"><b>Projective Verse</b></a> 6).</p>

                <p>Perhaps the poem-fragment on page 68 captures this best. Beginning with the asterisk (as I've mentioned) the poem reads:</p>
                <pre class = "col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
                    Litter chairs, the tops
                    of pens, motes as unknowable
                    as stars. A sore spot
                    on my spacing thumb
                    I hear the voice    (68)</pre>
                <p class="col-md-12">This poem captures all of the above are references to the materiality of language (pens), and how these score the page, as Olson reflects on, as well as to stars and asterisks which both omit a type of presence and yet acknowledge a type of absence. </p>


                <p class = "col-md-12">If, as I said earlier, <b>Think Tank</b> is a poetics of alignment, it is also a poetics marked by various moments of fragmentation. Indeed, another use of the word asterisk is to indicate the omission of words or letters. The result of this bifurcating poetic of alignment and fragmentation could be akin to seeing (even hearing) "incoherent patterns through the candlelight" (6).</p>

                <p>Indeed, Charles Bernstein notes: </p>
                <pre class = 'text-center'>Three types of fragmentation, or three aspects of any fragment: disjunction, ellipsis, constellation (Recalculating, 7)</pre>
                <p>
                And so I've taken this "review" and shuffled all the words randomly into a new review. What was once a constellation of syntax and grammar becomes now fragmented. What is <em>its</em> voice? How does it announce or enunciate itself? 
                </p>
