            <p>Stephen Mclaughlin from <a href="https://jacket2.org/podcasts/into-the-field-sina-queyras">Jacket 2</a> refers to Queyras’ work as ‘conceptually inflected’. The phrase is useful for approaching Queyras’ work: the overlaps and contradictions built between these two terms generates an unexpected feedback loop for such a poetic. One suggests the presence of an author, and the other (note the near-homophone) the absence of the author: “inflection” implies the alteration of grammar expressly for expression, and is intimate with “voice”, with melopoeia, and hence some entity composing the poem. While “conceptual” implies the recontextualizing of existing texts, or producing texts with predetermined constraints, and thus strictly limiting or ‘removing’ any authorial interventions.</p>

            <p>Of course, all conceptual writing is nonetheless expressive; derek beaulieu in  <a href="http://www.wlupress.wlu.ca/Catalog/dobson-beaulieu.shtml" target="_blank">Please, No More Poetry</a> remains most level-headed: “The selection, re-organization and re-presentation of material reflects [one’s] individual decision-making process and is as indicative of their personality as any other poetic process” (beaulieu). But what Queyras leverages here specifically are the expressive potentials conceptual poetic practices have for the lyric tradition; Queyras shows us that even a cyborg can still sing. </p>

        <p>The conceptual inflections of MxT are generated partly by its ‘pataphysical bent toward classifying the experience of grief as a discipline, an art or science, a techne. Such imaginary apercus consist of phrases like: “Always use a tether when feeling in public. Never dive in alone.” and “If you have no control over your memories and they are of a constant voltage, minimize exposure to skin, use a semi-automatic memory welder with an excessive emotion-reducing device.” (21). Note the imperatives mimic the genre of a manual, much as the title of the poem, “A Manual for Remembering” acknowledges. However, this titular foregrounding of genre, pointing toward conventions, mining patterns of syntax, and overexposing cliches draws in part from a conceptual toolkit, while its semantic themes orbits cathexis, a pedagogy of elegy, and becomes with its numerous voices, “she”, “we” “Stevie Nicks”, “I”, a threnody. </p>

        <p>One of the more wholly ‘pataphysical investigations in the collection, “Ohm’s Law of Grieving”, imagines the work’s title as a formula: “Feeling = Memory x Time”, or “F = M x T” (51). What would otherwise be a vowel-less and unpronounceable title, is instead an imaginary solution to understanding ineffable grief or quantizing untranslatable traumas. And the cover design’s typographical inflections - the ornate looping font of “M” and “T” adjoining a glimmerslate ‘X’ - mimics the cross-wired discourses of the book: the lyrical with electrical engineering, the technological within the confessional. </p>

    <article class="col-md-7">
        <p>In this light, note that the various poetics of the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E school also promulgate an imaginary formula for language. Although slipperier than Queyras, this designation (if only so) for a group of writers also uses mathematical symbols to express a poetic hypothesis. If poetry is to be experimental, the discourses of science and mathematics are obviously metaphorically conducive to the task; to hypothesize, run, and analyze experiments is an attractive approach for poetics. Wordsworth, surprisingly, even thinks as much when in the Preface he proposes “that the powers of language are not so limited as [one] may suppose”. Until any bounds are adumbrated, experimentation prevails and any hypothesis may hold. The question becomes what are the poetic potentials and possibilities if L equals A equals N equals G equals U equals A equals G equals E? If feeling equals memory times time?</p>

        <p>The result of combining these polarities of language is what Queyras calls in the eponymous manifesto "<a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2012/04/lyric-conceptualism-a-manifesto-in-progress/">lyric conceptualism</a>". This charged interaction that works contra to Dworkin’s and Goldsmith’s anthology <a href="http://www.nupress.northwestern.edu/content/against-expression">Against Expression</a>; theirs explores “the potential of writing that tries to be ‘rid of lyrical interference of the individual as ego’”, and instead Queyras works to explore the “potential of [conceptual] writing” with the lyrical interference of the individual as ego (Dworkin xliii). Queyras even writes: “The Lyric Conceptualist is an excessive elegist”. Take Queyras' “Elegy Written in a City Cemetery” which recontextualizes fifty-two other elegies, splicing together disparate phrases into a prose poem replete with footnotes which both insistently short-circuit one’s reading of the poem, but also interrupt the boundaries between total appropriation (a la conceptual writing) and authorial referentiality (lyrical ‘originality’, ‘ownership’).</p>

        <p>Although at the Vancouver Writer’s Festival this past October Queyras called MxT “elegy, all elegy”, the elegiac here spills into long-poems, sonnets, prose-poems, epistolary addresses, concrete and visual poems, as well as conceptual pieces. And the source of this dynamic poetic I’ve suggested is Queyras’ “lyric conceptualism”. Plugging into various modes of composition ranging from the ‘pataphysical and the conceptual, to more formal, lyrical, and confessional modes, this poetic surges beyond any final conclusions, and “create[s] openings rather than closures” - its hypothesis plausible. </p>
