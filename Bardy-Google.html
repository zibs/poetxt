        		<p>Frank Bardy’s “Davey Google” (<em>did you mean</em>: Frank Davey's <a href="http://talonbooks.com/books/bardy-google"><b>Bardy Google</b></a>) cover-design - with its pastel-turquoisey background, lapis quill icon in the search query box, and ostensible search results for “Bardy Google”, a keyword salmagundi which conjures references to St. Augustine, T.S Eliot, Phillip Sydney, digital epistemology viz. textuality, lingerie, the imaginary, globalization, and CanLit -  depicts no search engine I know of. Rhizomatic in reference and relation (contra the standardized neo-Aristotelian organization of information) these diverse search results form the headings for each section in the book. Thus the very format of the book deviates from the I/O of quotidian search, instead subsuming a multiplicity of searches into single result.</p>

        		<p>The back of the cover informs the reader that: “With only one hidden exception, each of the texts in this book was constructed through Davey’s use of specifically devised Internet searches.” Teasing, such a statement remains within the tradition that close-reading should will reveal some “reward”, egging the reader on to see if they can carefully discern (search out) the difference between the computer-generated texts and the “human-generated” texts - much like this <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/books/2013/08/harry-potter-character-or-friedrich-nietzsche.html">quiz on whether you can discern the difference between Harry Potter and Nietzche</a>. But let’s remember that in one of his letters, Nietzsche also states: “Our writing tools are also working on our thoughts” (<em>Gramophone, Film, Typewriter</em>, Friedrich Kittler 209). Typing on a keyboard is a process of composition, functioning in what Kittler refers to as a “discourse network” or “writing system” that differs radically than the typewriter.  Thus, “human-generated” texts written on a computer keyboard, such as this one, are far less “human-generated” than we may think, actively participating in a discourse network - this is not writing in any traditional sense, these letters are constituted by electric transmissions flicking switches. Even if Davey's outlier text was written by hand, it was at one point at least typewritten in order to be printed, and so the statement feels only like its angling in fencereaders and not actually inviting dialogue about the the compositional method itself.

        		<p>Davey in the “Preface” also states that “the texts are part of my ongoing work to use the sentence as the basic structural unit of poetry” (7). What’s most intriguing here is the composition of the sentences Davey collates. Bracketing the disputed ontology of a sentence, I so rarely search in sentences, instead searching through disparate keywords. This is obvious, but search engines encourage grammatical distortion,  opting for keywords of constellatory semantics and elided phrases. Nonetheless, by relying on the sentence as the unit of composition, as theorized in Ron Silliman’s “The New Sentence”, Davey’s work follows the dictum most explicitly stated in Silliman’s <a href="http://www.ubu.com/ubu/pdf/silliman_chinese.pdf"><b>The Chinese Notebook</a></b> that “[l]anguage is, first of all, a political question”(4). Davey confirms that the work “constitutes another of my forays into cultural commentary” (7).</p>

        		<p>Initial poems begin with the recontextualizations of sentences which reveal an elasticity of language, certain phrases being translatable into sundry sentences. This versatility of verbatim expressions in different contexts...what?  There is also the occasional moment of <em>syzygia</em> when two or more sentences align semantically to propel a micro-narrative. The sentences have a pristine feeling to them - a fallacious claim of course. But as found language relocated they emit an aura of their previous context: their writers, their readers, remain a wonder.</p>

        		<p>Rippling through the superabundance of language that composes the internet, other poems plunk into this pelagic space to underscore the mass similitude of sentences. The same news stories can be rewritten, reworked, reworded, inverted, or everted for innumerable websites. Key phrases are massaged, emphasized and repeated with different stresses and prosodies depending on their place within a headline. Search engine optimization encourages this type of homogeneity in article titling to appease a search engine’s desires, plethora of starfish cling to coral.</p>

        		<p>But things become much different beginning in the poem sequence “Time Lapse Action” - here we get some real indeterminacy. It feels like walking into a public library and taking the fourth sentence from the third paragraph from everyone’s computer who is online reading whatever at 1:17pm on a Wednesday. It feels aleatoric, but it’s not quite since Davey’s text is collated through the constraint of its search terms. One keyword in this sequence is the word “stay” which bifurcates between political and legal discourses before morphing irreversibly into pure lyricism - that is, text from pop lyric websites. This slip from the political to the popular is due to what Davey writes “abrupt changes in search engine protocol”. The saccharine shift is unnerving, and again unveils the politicized nature of language, the politics embedded in search. Davey exposes the biases of search, showing that “[l]anguage, first of all, is a political question”, one which search-engines are also subject to. What and who defines “relevance”? </p>

        	<article class="row">
        		<p>This extensive parataxis and indeterminacy coupled with recontextualization is an effective strategy to defamiliarize and reify a word’s inexhaustible capacity to mean: “[a] lot of people get intimidated when they have to defuse a bomb, but there’s no reason it can’t be a satisfying encounter. I remember being scared to death the first time I had to tie a bow tie, and it turned out to be a piece of cake” (45). Here notions of <em>techné</em>, phalanges, and the filamentary crisscross into an image of tension and release, destruction and aesthesis. Taken from the poem “Global Positioning” in which the recurring term is “bomb”, one is reawoken to the explosive power of signification, its violent and poetic potentials, and thus its political facet. </p>

        		What's refreshing about Davey's work here is that it is not <em>just</em> Flarf as one might expect from poetry composed using search results. If it could even be labelled as Flarf (and I think it partially can be read as Flarf), it is nonetheless a Flarf matured, a Flarf with dose of formalism that lassos the disjunctive and dislocating strategies of Flarf, redirecting that energy from Flarf's initial beginnings wherein, as Gary Sullivan writes in his <a href="http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/text/brief-guide-flarf-poetry">A Brief Guide to Flarf Poetry</a> "[t]he flarf “voice” in my head was that of my father, a transplanted Southerner who likes to pontificate, and who has a lot of opinions that kind of horrify me" to a kind of Flarf that still contains those kinds of dumbfounding moments but now they are integrated into a procedural poetic that has a range of voices and registers, operating on in with various discourses. It is a Flarf that has been "re-searched" literally as per Davey's constraint, but also metaphorically as Flarf that becomes more self-reflective and introspective as a genre, searching its own voices and what that might mean.</p>
