              <p>The poetic impulse must be partly sphygmomanometrical. It constricts around a thing. It applies pressurization. It works through intensities. Jaime Sharpe writes: "The white cutting board / must become something." (39). What is this "something" an object must become in a poem? What does the "white cutting board", a tabula rasa, transform into? Must it become "something [else]" in this process? Of course, the word "metaphor" refers etymologically to a <em>carrying across</em>, a type of <em>transference</em>. This evocative and declarative sentence, "The white cutting board / must become something" comes from the poem  "Picture" found in Jaime Sharpe's first collection of poetry, <a href="http://mansfieldpress.net/2012/04/sympathy-loophole/"><b><u>Sympathy Loophole</u></b></a>, and I think the emotive and poetic urgency of the statement carries through the collection. There is, if not an obsession with somehow framing (squeezing, transforming) objects poetically, an eager embrace and open integration of objects, the quotidian, and the overlooked into the poetry. Object-oriented poetry perhaps. This particular poem is made of what feel like stillshot images. The statements feel like fragments of memories that swish and "flip by without corners" (39). There are often commas which superimpose these fragments, overlaying them. The multiple repeating double-letters in the line "the jiggling blurry knee" captures (or mimics) at the level of language the effect of this poetic double exposure (39). Those two g's an two 'rs and two e's refract back on each other.  It is a poetic of double-takes, thinking and looking twice at something as though you know you're missing something that's there: "[a]bsent: the broken cobalt tone / of her voice, the jiggling blurry knee" (39). It is a poetic of double-takes, where the "white cutting board / must become something" (39).</p> 

              <p>This isn't a poetic that awaits or just plunders the ol' "visionary moment", however. Instead of moments of clarity, lightness, and immanent illumination, "[t]here were thick file folders, / neon tabs marking the seasons" (19). Instead of nightinggales, in the last poem a "garage band soundchecks / in the garage" (56). Earler in the collection a list poem titled "Things I'll Never Forget" ends with the line "[a] soundcheck at dawn" (50). I think the soundcheck fits with the poetic here as well. Anticipatory, accidental, a sound-check precedes a more orchestrated performance, accrues clusters of energy, like the cutting board which undoubtedly "will become something" (39). Not tuned to perfect harmonies or well-grooved frequencies, the attention here is often placed on what is abrupt; the object or event that forces a double-take. Soundchecking is a type of intentional listening, of preparing and warming up for a performance (itself is a performance), but it is can also be an improvisatory space. Though I feel some type of improvisatory formal experimentation would benefit the syntax and semantics in this work.  </p> 
               
               <p>The sphygmomanometrical encompasses much. It encloses and heightens. The scattering catalogue of: "I played dead, listed burials of favourite wells, / drew a blueprint for a raft, operated by pickup truck / science and lucky numbers" commingles death, subaquaeous zones, and schematic drafts of imaginary vehicles in order to conjure some conception of a nautical machine of good fortune. In this case, those "blueprints" become a document, overlayed with symbolic meanings. The blueprints, like the cutting board, becomes something else, when marked with pencil and imagination. What "pick up truck / science" is uncertain to me, but "luck" echoes "truck", and so perhaps its a type of <em>bricoleur</em> handywomanship (the boat, the boat). </p>
