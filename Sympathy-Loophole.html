              <p>The poetic impulse must be partly sphygmomanometrical. It constricts around a thing. It applies a pressurization. It works through intensities. Jaime Sharpe writes: "The white cutting board / must become something." (39). What is this "something" an object must become in a poem? What does the "white cutting board", a tabula rasa, transform into? Must it become "something [else]" in this process? Of course, the word "metaphor" refers etymologically to a <em>carrying across</em>, a type of <em>transference</em>. This evocative and declarative sentence, "The white cutting board / must become something" comes from the poem  "Picture" found in Jaime Sharpe's first collection of poetry, <a href="http://mansfieldpress.net/2012/04/sympathy-loophole/"><b><u>Sympathy Loophole</u></b></a>, and I think the emotive and poetic urgency of the statement carries through the collection. There is, if not an obsession with somehow framing (squeezing, transforming) objects poetically, an eager embrace and open integration of objects, of the quotidian and the overlooked, into the poetry. Object-oriented poetry perhaps. This particular poem is made of stillshot images. The statements feel like fragments of memories that swish and "flip by without corners" (39). There are often commas which superimpose these fragments, overlaying them.</p>

              <p></p>

              <p>The scattering catalogue of: "I played dead, listed burials of favourite wells, / drew a blueprint for a raft, operated by pickup truck / science and lucky numbers" doesn't really fit my argument here, but I still love the line (46). Death, subaquaeous zones, and schematic drafts of imaginary vehicles all commingle to conjure some conception of a nautical machine of good fortune. In this case, those "blueprints" become a document, and in a sense, this is a type of transference. The blueprints, like the cutting board, becomes something else, when overlaid with pencil and imagination. I mean, what "pick up truck / science" is unclear to me, but later, "luck" echoes truck, and I assume its a type of <em>bricoleur</em> handywomanship (the boat, the boat). </p>
