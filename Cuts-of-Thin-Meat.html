            <p> Let me pull from one of Steff's bios:
               <pre class="steff">Steffanie Ling is a writer, mostly...Currently, she is writing a book of letters and stories that weigh in on banality, social awkwardness and smoking.</pre>
                 <!-- Her essays, criticism and art writing have been published alongside exhibitions, in-print and online in Canada and the United States. She is the editor of Bartleby Review, an occasional pamphlet of criticism and writing in Vancouver, and a curator at CSA Space.  -->
            </p>
            <p><span class = "note"></span> The rhythmic dangle of that first sentence

            <p><span class = "note"></span> With its ambiguously hanging near-apocopic, adverbial modifier</p>
            <p><span class = "note"></span>and comma pause.</p>

            <p><span class = "note"></span> The phrase "book of letters" </p>

            <p><span class = "note"></span> In a interview with Sung Pil Yoon of <a href="http://spare-room.ca/"><u>Spare Room</u></a>, Steff refers to some of these poems as "word-based" poems</p>

            <p><span class = "note"></span> In that same interview, Steff refers to these poems as hovering between concrete poetry and minimalist poetry</p>

            <p><span class = "note"></span> The attention here to componentization, to words, to letters, to categorization: what the activity of writing includes or excludes: concrete poetry viz. minimalist poetry</p>

            <p><span class = "note"></span> As object, as book of ['letters', 'words'], as ['word', 'letter']-based poems, the work comes wrapped as a bánh mì sandwich would, papered and taped and crinkling </p>

            <p><span class = "note"></span> The sheets are large - think A2 size - folded in half, with one poem on each folded page inside</p>

            <p> <span class = "note"></span> Heavy weighted unripened-olive coloured hardcarded paper holds the unbounded, loose sheafs of paper inside</p>
            <p><span class = "note"></span> Yes, the book is unbound - instead, each page is loose and stacked, like thin cuts of meat</p>
            <p><span class = "note"></span> Each sheet/slice contains two poems </p>
            <p><span class = "note"></span> This particular formatting allows a near boundless permutability to the work</p>
            <p><span class = "note"></span> There is also a table of contents on the inside of the cover</p>
            <p><span class = "note"></span> But while the poems ostensibly have titles, these aren't included on the page of the poem </p>

            <p><span class = "note"></span> Still, with a bit of work, you can figure out which title may have been intended for which poem </p>
            <p><span class = "note"></span> If you were to rearrange these loose sheets in every combination possible, there would be <strong>39,916,800</strong> different ways of ordering the work</p>
            <p><span class = "note"></span> Although there is no overt over-arching organizing principle of this work, each re-ordering would nevertheless produce its own reading, producing a unique context within which to read the works off each other</p>
            <p><span class = "note"></span> The work kind of deflates and sort of exaggerates this absurdity by blessing(?) the work with its semi-functional table of contents</p>
            <p><span class = "note"></span> Wait</p>
            <p><span class = "note"></span> Since the poems do not reference a title specifically on their page, each poem could be retitled in each reordering</p>
            <p><span class = "note"></span> This leaves us with the possibility of <pre>809,429,852,527,344,373,968,162,284,449,350,829,970,823,063,097,016,070,457,762,336,284,976,604,266,405,217,133,917,739,979,101,827,382,870,741,850,789,049,568,566,634,393,183,827,450,477,162,148,411,476,507,217,602,230,720,921,600,000,000,000,000,000,000,00,000,000</pre> different variations of the book </p>
            <p><span class = "note"></span> Nice</p>
            <p><span class = "note"></span> The reading order I read may not have been the order you read </p>
            <p><span class = "note"></span> The poems are slivers, mostly</p>
            <p><span class = "note"></span> Thin slices of text cutting across a page surrounded by a vast albescence</p>
            <p><span class = "note"></span> Deliberately miniscule font-sizes further accentuate the enormity of the encompassing white space</p>
            <p><span class = "note"></span> This in turn magnifies and clarifies each line</p>
            <p><span class = "note"></span> Such near-blank pages, with minimal textual interventions allows each work (word) to accrue a kind of density </p>
            <p><span class = "note"></span> A kind of focus</p>
            <p><span class = "note"></span> There is a visual symmetry at play in a number of these poems:
              <pre>
             Do you want a glass of water? I'm getting a glass of water.
             I'm getting a glass of water. Do you want a glass of water?</pre> </p>
             <p><span class = "note"></span> It is a visual poem of two equally lengthed strips of text</p>
             <p><span class = "note"></span> It is linguistic poem that is a palindrome at the level of the sentence </p>
             <p><span class = "note"></span> Its voice: urgent, banal; reversals, mirrors</p>
             <p><span class = "note"></span> Your imagined inflections while reading it</p>
             <p><span class = "note"></span> How repetition punctures banality </p>
             <p><span class = "note"></span> How minimalist poetry punctures blank pages</p>
             <p><span class = "note"></span> How repetition redoubles one's attention</p>
             <p><span class = "note"></span> Like when someone asks you twice if you want a glass of water</p>
             <p><span class = "note"></span> Another quasi-palindrome, semi-anagrammatical poem reads:
             <pre class="text-center">
  emiles
  smiles</pre></p>
              <p><span class = "note"></span> Again, a visual symmetry </p>
              <p><span class = "note"></span> That upon closer inspection goes awry</p>
              <p><span class = "note"></span> Minimalist formalism architecting verbal and visual spaces</p>
              <p><span class = "note"></span> The errant inclinations of the poem, its deviation from 100% pure sense suggest the dizzying folds - the infinite ridges - of interpretation, the translucence of thin meat, its wavery form, its malleability, its almost liquid adaptation (like language) to its environment, the way that, as the errant trickster Hamlet puts it, "one may smile, and smile, and be a villain", which is in any case, a similar dislocation of the verbal and the visual</p>
              <p><span class = "note"></span> The flourish, the wooping double 'e', the unfolded answer me 's', and textually, visually, their tripartite trinity</p>
              <p><span class = "note"></span> <pre class="col-md-4 col-md-offset-4">

              <p><span class = "note"></span> How much time imagery takes</p>

                </audio><br>so in the interview I mentioned above, and that most precious audio file right up there, Steff gives her first reading of these poems, and the poem she reads is the word "wall", except it is the word "wall" with many, many more "w's" and "a's" than we usually find it with before the final two couplet-like "l's" which are left unaltered to give some general semblance to the "word" we generally think of as "wall", although visually it is pretty much completely almost unrecognizable as any word since it has so many letters, think maybe like thirty "w's" and just as many "a's", although again, that godless table of contents still decides to call this poem "wall" if that's worth anything at all, but even beyond quasi-semantico-visually resembling the word "word" "wall", but of course the poem also visually stretches across the entire page and so also looks like an actual wall of language, as Steff reads through the poem, she reads each letter aloud, as separate, not as a single drawn out long-breathed word, but as letter, "double-you double-you double-you" (remember all those 'i's in the poem "painting"?) she reads each letter complete with a myriad of tonal inflections, slight variations in pitch and pace, pauses which differentiate and accent nuances between spoken and seen letters, some of which drone out over longer periods of time, some of which are spoken rapidly and staccatoing, and here, although it is ostensibly Steff's first reading, a definite compelling rhythm develops, especially as the timbre shifts from vocal frying to fuller breathed voicings, which are staggered by both the audience and Steff sometimes laughing aloud, but still what we realize as each letter is uniquely spoken aloud is that each spoken letter is a unique instantiation of itself in the world, entangled in its immediate context to which it points, marks thoroughly, and dissolves, and here between the poem punctuated by breaths and pauses these letters become a sonic drone that sound less like individual letters and more like some inchoate gestalt of language, some dash of an <em>Ursprache</em>, although of course we learn to speak with words, not letters, but still then eventually we learn to granularize, componentize words into letters, visualize the sonic - categorize - which is exactly what these poems are doing already, bringing attention to their "word-based"-ness, their letter-based-ness, their language-ness against blank-ness, what the suffix -ness- does to a word, illuminating both what's caught in its attempted categorization, cataloguing the days in the week, and what might just slip through such attempts, how difficult or impossible it can be to articulate and recount these imperatives of categorization, just as Steff's bio tells us how she is a "writer, mostly", the extra comma, the tacked on adverb, the minimal intervention most interesting</p>




<!--



                The poem is punctuated by breath and by pauses. The letter's become a sonic drone and less like letters. The aural poem is hardly the word "wall", though it tyopgraphically resembles it. Like Steff's bio tells us, she is a "writer, mostly". Indeed she is, but its that swerving typographical mark and the pause in the breath of the sentence, that shows and tells us that something else is happening here.</p>



              There is also a type of flourish, both vocally and textually in these (mostly) single breath doses of poetry. One poem:
              <pre class="text-center">
             New York
             so expensive</pre>
             captures the vocal aspect aptly. Four words and six syllables total, the poem concisely points to ennui and quotidian argot, to cliche and interpellated discourse. An updated objective correlative of Pound perhaps, marked more by banalities than imagery. A poetry of complaints.</p>
             <p>Other textual flourishes occur in the more "concrete" poems where certain typefaces and font decorations accent their serifs. One poem is simply the word "painting" with many, many "i's", and even more dots per 'i' than would be possible to produce on a keyboard.</p>


The minimalist formalism here juggles both verbal and visual languages as a balancing act. However, the errant inclinations of the poem, its deviation from 100% pure sense suggest the dizzying folds - the infinite ridges - of interpretation, the translucence of thin meat, its wavery form, its malleability, its almost liquid adaptation (like language) to its environment, the way that, as the errant trickster Hamlet puts it, "one may smile, and smile, and be a villain", which is in any case, a similar dislocation of the verbal and the visual.

        <article class="row">
          <section>
            <p>As object, as book of ['letters', 'words'], as ['word', 'letter']-based poems, the work comes wrapped as a bánh mì sandwich would, papered and taped and crinkling. A heavy weighted unripened-olive colored hardcarded paper holds the loose sheafs of paper inside. That is, the book is unbound - instead, each page is loose and stacked, like thin cuts of meat. Each sheet/slice contains two poems and the sheets are large - think A2 size - folded in half, with one poem on each folded page inside.
            </p>
            <p>While this unbound, loose-sheafed format allows a permutability to the work, there is also a table of contents on the inside of the cover. However, though the poem's ostensibly have titles, they aren't included on the page of the poem. Still, with a bit of work, you can figure out which poem is which. The permutative possibilities are pretty tantalizing though. For example, this work could slip into a Borgesian vortex pretty quick, if you were to rearrange these loose sheets in every combination possible, there would be 39,916,800 different ways of ordering the work. Although there is no overt over-arching organizing principle of this work, each re-ordering would nevertheless produce its own reading, producing a unique context within which to read the works off each other. This form of publications has some unexplored potentials here. Still, the work deflates (or exaggerates?) this absurdity by blessing the work with its semi-functional table of contents. Actually, since the poems do not reference a title specifically on their page, each poem could be retitled in each reordering. This leaves us with the possibility of <pre>809,429,852,527,344,373,968,162,284,449,350,829,970,823,063,097,016,070,457,762,336,284,976,604,266,405,217,133,917,739,979,101,827,382,870,741,850,789,049,568,566,634,393,183,827,450,477,162,148,411,476,507,217,602,230,720,921,600,000,000,000,000,000,000,00,000,000</pre> different variations of the book. Nice.
              </p>
              <p>The poems are slivers, mostly. Thin slices of text cutting across a page surrounded by a vast albescence. The font size is deliberatly miniscule which further accents the enormity of the encompassing white space. This in turn magnifies and clarifies each line. These near-blank pages, with minimal textual interventions, allows each work (word even) to accrue a kind of density and focus.</p>
              <p> This has a number of interesting implications: for one, there is a type of visual symmetry at work in a number of the poems. One poem reads: <pre>
        Do you want a glass of water? I'm getting a glass of water.
        I'm getting a glass of water. Do you want a glass of water?</pre>

       At a distance, the minute typeface coupled with its surrounding white space allows the work to function as a visual poem of two equally lengthed strips of text. Semantically however, the poem is also a palindrome at the level of the sentence (as well as a perfect anagram). Further, with the repetition and mirroring of these lines there is a peculiar voice that emerges. Though its content is banal, the voice carries a surprising urgency in its repetitive asking. The effect of this repetition punctures the banality of the question, much as the minimal poem punctures the blank page. The repetition and inversion of the line re-doubles one's attention (perhaps away from some Borgesian daydreamlike realm), just like when someone asks you twice if you want a glass of water.</p>
           <p>Another quasi-palindrome, semi-anagramtical poem reads:
           <pre class="text-center">
emiles
smiles</pre>
           Again, from a distance there is a visual symmetry that upon closer inspection goes awry. The minimalist formalism here juggles both verbal and visual languages as a balancing act. However, the errant inclinations of the poem, its deviation from 100% pure sense suggest the dizzying folds - the infinite ridges - of interpretation, the translucence of thin meat, its wavery form, its malleability, its almost liquid adaptation (like language) to its environment, the way that, as the errant trickster Hamlet puts it, "one may smile, and smile, and be a villain", which is in any case, a similar dislocation of the verbal and the visual. </p>
           <p>
             There is also a type of flourish, both vocally and textually in these (mostly) single breath doses of poetry. One poem:

          <p>One last thing: if I can get the audio to the track, I'll link it here, but in that interview mentioned above, Steff gives her first reading of one of these poems. The poem is the word "wall", but with many "w's" and "a's" before teh final two "l's". As she reads each letter aloud there are tonal inflections, differences in pitch and pace, pauses and nuance, some letters drone out longer, some are spoken rapidly, a rhythm develops, timbre changes, and each letter is spoken aloud differently. The poem is punctuated by breath and by pauses. The letter's become a sonic drone and less like letters. The aural poem is hardly the word "wall", though it tyopgraphically resembles it. Like Steff's bio tells us, she is a "writer, mostly". Indeed she is, but its that swerving typographical mark and the pause in the breath of the sentence, that shows and tells us that something else is happening here.</p>
