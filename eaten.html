The two part poem collects every word in the English language that has either the word lol or yolo within it. The poems wonders about the frequent occurrence of the word lol within so many chemical compounds, as if the building blocks of life itself contained some obscure punchline, as well as serendipity that a word like yolo is found within a word like embryology. Sure of the truth in this matter, but somewhat unsure about the poems effectiveness, the boy agrees to read it: hopefully this was the right choice

But what if this poem can't be trusted. Like I don’t think the word gooseberryologists is actually a word? Or what if the complete opposite is true. How could an ordinary poem be this lucky, or unlucky, depending on the turnout. Only one way to find out. 

The casual life of a poem takes a sharp turn as a childhood friend enters his life.
The childhood friend claims the poem is in grave danger. Supposedly a psycho killer is lurking nearby, sleuthing by moonlight, studying every move, ready to strike at any moment. The person claims to know the killer and offers protection from this psycho in the form of a disguise. Sure of the truth in this situation, but somewhat distrustful of this childhood friend, the poem somewhat gladly agrees to the proposal, no matter what, something has to be done in this situation, hopefully this was the right choice.
But what if this childhood friend is not speaking the truth. Or what if somebody is orchestrating all of this. How could an ordinary poem end up in a situation like this. Only one way to find out. 

Theorizers cassius lifelike of a boycott taker a shaving turbulence as a chips frivolous entertained historian lifting.

Theorizes children frivolous clays these boyhood is in granola danization. Superposes a psychologist kilimanjaro is lurked neatness, slew by moored, stupid events movie, reader to stringently at anyplace momentous. Then perception cladding to knockout theater kiloword andalusian officialdom prohibits frozen thickets psychoanalyst. Surmount of these trustfulness in thicket situations, butted somewhere disqualified of thieving chides frivolously, theorization boy someplace glared agrarian to theology proliferation, no maternal whatever, somalia has to be donates in thickens sit, hopper thigh wasserman thetis righted choreograph.
Butterer whacking if thin chirp frills is notices spec thermal truncation. Or whack if somewhere is orchestra allen of thickly. However courters an ordered boycotts endangers up in a situational likelihood thirds. Online oneness ways to finer outputting.  

The casual life of a boy will change forever as another poem enters his life.
The poem catalogues every use of the word moon, either as a prefix, or as common phrase found in the Oxford English Dictionary. The poem claims if language is a product of our environment, it should be unsurprising that the most poetic of celestial objects, the moon, should engender such inexhaustible linguistic inspiration. Sure of the truth in this situation, but somewhat uncertain of the poem’s readability, the boy agrees to read it, something has to be done in this situation, hopefully this was the right choice:

Moon Poem

But what if this list is incomplete, like why wasn’t the word moonlight listed? Or what if he omitted the other part of the poem that does the exact same thing only with the word sun? How could an ordinary young boy be relied upon in something this big. Only one way to find out.

The stable life of a woman changes in an instant as a stranger enters her life. 

The stranger claims the woman is now cursed along with everybody else in this town. Why? By whom? What kind of curse exactly? Nobody seems to know, but the person supposedly responsible for this curse will explain everything at the town hall this afternoon, everybody should come. Concerned of the situation and a little distrustful of this stranger, the woman somewhat grudgingly agrees to the proposal, the choice was made fast, perhaps too fast, but this situation requires quick thinking. Hopefully this was the right choice.

But what if this stranger can't be trusted. Or what if the complete opposite is true. How could an ordinary woman be this lucky, or unlucky, depending on the turnout. Only one way to find out.

Then stalemate lifespan of a women chastely in an insupportable as a stress entreat herding lifted.

Therefore strictly clamps theodosius women is nowhere cursing aloofness witches evelyn elsevier in thing towering. Why? By whorls? Wharf kingwood of cursor exams? Nobles seedlings to knoll, buttresses theological perched supplants residual forthcoming thinkable curt willis experimentally every at thermometers towed hallways thickest after, evenly showcase comparator. Concentrate of they sitters anding a litigation disassembled of this strives, therapy womanhood somber grubs agreement to thermodynamics prowler, thermometer chorused wasps madagascar fasted, persisted too faster, buttress thinks situations requires quilts thin. Hopes thieves washburn theoretic rightmost chocolate.

Button whaler if thiensville straggled cantons't be trustworthiness. Or what if thermal compounded oppositeness is truncated. However couples an orderlies womanly be thinking lucks, or unlocked, depended on theatricals turtles. Onlooker oneiric ways to finishes outstripping.  

The calm life of a boy takes a sharp turn as another poem enters his life.
The poem is yet another list poem, and it collects pretty much every word that describes one who uses too many words. A meta-meta-critique, the poem asks like why do we have so many words to describe using too many words? Sure of the truth in this situation, but somewhat distrustful of the poems prosody, the boy agrees to read it. The choice was made fast, hopefully this was the right choice.
