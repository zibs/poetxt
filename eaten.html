The childhood friend claims the woman is in grave danger. Supposedly a psycho killer is lurking nearby, studying every move, ready to strike at any moment. The person claims to know the killer and offers protection from this psycho. Sure of the truth in this situation, but somewhat distrustful of this childhood friend, the woman somewhat gladly agrees to the proposal, no matter what, something has to be done in this situation, hopefully this was the right choice.
But what if this childhood friend is not speaking the truth. Or what if somebody is orchestrating all of this. How could an ordinary woman end up in a situation like this. Only one way to find out. 

The normal life of a young girl will change forever as a childhood friend enters her life. 
The childhood friend claims the young girl is needed, all capable hands are needed. The dam is breaking and if we don't get every person working on repairing it the entire town might be destroyed by the following flood. Sure of the truth in this situation, but somewhat distrustful of this childhood friend, the young girl somewhat hesitantly agrees to the proposal, the situation is all too strange, hopefully this was the right choice.
But what if this childhood friend is trying be misleading. Or what if all this is an elaborate trap. How could an ordinary young girl be relied upon in something this big. Only one way to find out. 

The casual life of a boy will change forever as a poem enters his life.
The poem catalogues every use of the word moon, either as a prefix, or as common phrase found in the Oxford English Dictionary. The poem claims if language is a product of our environment, it should be unsurprising that the most poetic of celestial objects, the moon, should engender such ostensibly inexhaustible linguistic inspiration. Sure of the truth in this situation, but somewhat uncertain of the poem’s readability, the boy agrees to read it, something has to be done in this situation, hopefully this was the right choice:

But what if this list is incomplete, like why wasn’t the word moonlight listed? Or what if I omitted the other part of the poem that does the exact same thing only with the word sun? How could an ordinary young boy be relied upon in something this big. Only one way to find out.

The stressful life of a young girl is going the complete opposite way as a strange boy enters her life.

The strange boy claims the young girl will have to make a choice: join the army or leave the country. The nation is at war and everybody is needed to win it. Who started it and what the reason is, is 'not a concern for the people', but a choice must be made and it's implied the army is the right choice. Certain of the truth in this situation and of this strange boy, the young girl hesitantly agrees to the proposal, it all seemed rather odd, but there was no time to waste and a choice had to be made; hopefully this was the right choice.

But what if this strange boy is just a crazy person. Or what if the situation is worse than it appears. How could an ordinary young girl end up in a situation like this. Only one way to find out.

The stable life of a woman changes in an instant as a stranger enters her life. 

The stranger claims the woman is now cursed along with everybody else in this town. Why? By whom? What kind of curse exactly? Nobody seems to know, but the person supposedly responsible for this curse will explain everything at the town hall this afternoon, everybody should come. Concerned of the situation and a little distrustful of this stranger, the woman somewhat grudgingly agrees to the proposal, the choice was made fast, perhaps too fast, but this situation requires quick thinking. Hopefully this was the right choice.

But what if this stranger can't be trusted. Or what if the complete opposite is true. How could an ordinary woman be this lucky, or unlucky, depending on the turnout. Only one way to find out. 

The fast-paced life of a boy changes in an instant as a poem enters his life. 
The two part poem collects every word in the English language that has either the word lol or yolo within it. The poems wonders about the frequent occurrence of the word lol within so many chemical compounds, as if the building blocks of life itself contained some obscure punchline, as well as that the word yolo is found within the word embryology. Sure of the truth in this matter, but somewhat unsure about the poems effectiveness, the boy agrees to read it: hopefully this was the right choice.

The fast-paced life of a boy changes in an instant as a stranger enters his life.

The stranger claims the boy looks exactly like an evil leader and this offers a perfect opportunity to take out this leader through deception and spy games, which, although very risky, would save millions of innocent lives. Unsure about everything, including this stranger, the boy somewhat reluctantly agrees to the proposal, it was probably a good idea to make a quick decision anyway. Hopefully this was the right choice.

But what if this stranger cannot be relied upon. Or what if this proposal is wrong or missing important details. How could an ordinary boy be this lucky, or unlucky, depending on the turnout. Only one way to find out.


The quiet life of a man has a chance to change, for better or worse, as a strange woman enters his life.

The strange woman claims the man is in for a fun day. A new casino opened up in town and is giving everybody a free roll on their slot machine, with a little luck who knows what could happen. Sure of the truth in this situation, but somewhat distrustful of this strange woman, the man hastily agrees to the proposal, hopefully this was the right choice to make, all of this has to have some truth to it.

But what if this strange woman is trying be misleading. Or what if this proposal is wrong or missing important details. How could an ordinary man figure out the truth in all of this. Only one way to find out.

The calm life of a boy takes a sharp turn as a strange poem enters his life.
The poem is yet another list poem, and it collects pretty much every word that describes one who uses too many words. A meta-meta-critique, the poem asks like why do we have so many words to describe using too many words? Sure of the truth in this situation, but somewhat distrustful of the poems prosody, the boy agrees to read it. The choice was made fast, hopefully this was the right choice.

But what if this poem _____. Or what if this proposal is wrong or missing important details. How could an ordinary man figure out the truth in all of this. Only one way to find out.

The normal life of a teenage girl will be permanently altered as a strange woman enters his life.

The strange woman claims the teenage girl is no longer an assumed orphan, the father has been found and what a magnificent man he is. He's waiting at the town hall, ready to make up for leaving family life so early. Concerned of the situation and a little distrustful of this strange woman, the teenage boy somewhat reluctantly agrees to the proposal, there's no knowing what the right choice is anyway, so it's best to make one fast. Hopefully this was the right choice?

But what if this strange man can't be trusted. Or what if the complete opposite is true. How could an ordinary teenage girl be this important to the situation. Only one way to find out.

The normal life of a teenage boy has a chance to change, for better or worse, as a strange boy enters his life.

The strange boy claims the teenage boy is living on a crossing of ancient, magic ley lines which could hold the power to bring balance and peace to this world, but the house would need to be destroyed to access this power. Unsure what to think of all this and of this strange boy, the teenage boy oddly enthusiastically agrees to the proposal, the choice was made fast, perhaps too fast, but this situation requires quick thinking.

But what if this strange boy is just a crazy person. Or what if the wrong person was picked for this. How could an ordinary teenage boy figure out the truth in all of this. Only one way to find out.
